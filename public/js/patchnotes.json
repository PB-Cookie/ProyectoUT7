      "This patch contains new endgame tower maps, checkpoints for map areas, respawn attemps for the Arbiter of Ash, as well as many monster changes, unique changes, improvements and bug fixes.",
      "Endgame Changes",
      "Added 4 new Tower Map areas: Alpine Ridge, Bluff, Mesa, and Sinking Spire.",
      "The Lost Towers Map area has also been revamped.",
      "To address the problem of only having one attempt at the Arbiter of Ash Boss fight, you will now have up to six respawn attempts at this fight. Respawns can only be triggered by the person who put in the keys, and everyone in your party will be respawned at the same time. Leaving the Map still forfeits your attempt so you'll still need to fight the boss with the build you walked into the Map with. Higher difficulties of the Boss will lower the number of respawn attempts you receive. We'll be looking to add respawn attempts to other Pinnacle content over time.",
      "The Arbiter of Ash can no longer be interrupted during his falling flame seed skill. His flaming gale skill can no longer be blocked.",
      "The Arbiter of Ash Boss is now invulnerable for longer during its emergence and now takes significantly reduced damage while emerging.",

      "Map areas have been adjusted to have more distinct specialities for the content they contain. For example, one Map area might have more total number of monsters, while another is more likely to contain additional content such as Strongboxes, Essences or Shrines. Generally speaking, the more difficult a Map is to clear, or the smaller it is, the more axes it will specialise in. Here's an overview of changes we've made to give Maps more discernibility:",
      "A number of Maps now spawn up to double the number of Chests, and twice as many minimum Magic or Rare Chests.",

      "Reduced the damage scaling of Monsters in Simulacrum encounters with added Difficulty.",
      "Adjusted the chance for Maps to contain Bosses, you should be encountering a Boss roughly every 1 in 4 Maps.",
      "The chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher has been reduced to account for the increase in total number of Map Bosses.",
      "The Radiant Waystones Atlas Notable Passive now provides +15% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 25%).",
      "The small Map Boss Waystone Chance Passives now provide +6% chance for Map Bosses to drop a Waystone of the current tier or higher (previously 10%).",

      "Scavenged Plating now grants you stacks for a duration based on the enemy's rarity. Normal enemies grant 1 stack, Magic enemies grants 2 stacks, Rare enemies grant 5 stacks, and Unique enemies grant 10 stacks.",
      "The Lightning Bolt Skill granted by the Choir of the Storm Unique Amulet has been renamed to Greater Lightning Bolt to differentiate it from the Skill granted by Staves. Triggered Greater Lightning Bolts are now unable to trigger a subsequent Greater Lightning Bolt if the first was a Critical Hit. Greater Lightning Bolt now deals roughly 3.5 times more base Lightning Damage compared to Lightning Bolt.",
      "The Temporalis Unique Body Armour can no longer reduce the cooldown of a Skill to below 100ms.",
      "Skills socketed in a Meta Gem's sockets can no longer gain energy.",
      "Clarified Vine Arrow's description to explicitly state that it hits enemies on landing.",
      "Removed the Aura tag from Pain Offering for consistency with other minion skills, as the skill does not directly create an Aura (the Aura is created by the summoned minion).",

      "General Improvements and Changes",
      "Added the capacity to fast-travel between Checkpoints within an area. You can now select checkpoints which will bring up your Map Overlay allowing you to select other Checkpoints you have discovered in the area to travel to them immediately. Many more checkpoints have been added to areas generally at all the entrances and exits to areas, meaning if you find those first, you are able to instantly travel to them if you choose to go back and explore an area.",
      "Passive Point Respeccing has been made cheaper especially at higher levels, it had a relatively aggressive curve getting more expensive with character level, we have flattened that curve so it doesn't exponentially grow as much.

      "The volatiles spawned by the Volatile Fiends Trial of Chaos Modifier now accelerate over time.",

      "Skitter Golems no longer use basic attacks and instead now just explode as their attacks were largely unavoidable when in Melee Range.",
      "Serpent Clan burrow and ambush attacks now have improved visual telegraphing and cannot be used from as far away.",

      "Stormcaller Arrow's Bolt now gains additional Impact Radius as it Levels.",
      "Vine Arrow's Damage over Time has been adjusted, it is now slightly higher at Lower Levels, and substantially lower at Higher Levels. The intention of this ability was that you poison it to spread poisons, as opposed to the vine itself dealing immense amounts of Damage.",
      "Tornado Shot's Damage over Time has been adjusted, it is now slightly higher at Lower Levels, and substantially lower at Higher Levels. The intention of this ability was to propagate your other Bow skills, as opposed to doing an immense amount of damage itself.",

      "Improved attack in place behaviour.",
      "Rain of Arrows and Firestorm now have a hit-rate limit to prevent cases of them absolutely obliterating very large bosses. This will have little to no impact outside of boss fights with very large hitboxes.",
      "Leech has been buffed.",

One problem with the previous system is that if we balanced it to make triggering happen in boss fights then the triggering would happen far too often during clearing. In order to address this we are now making \"Monster Power\" part of the calculation for energy gain. This means that it's far easier to trigger skills from Unique Monsters than it is from normal monsters, but you also hit many more normal monsters when fighting. Another issue was using low level skills with unconditional ailment applications such as Flame Wall to ignite enemies for triggering. In order to make the source of the ignite matter we are making the energy gain be dependent on the strength of the ignite. We have also rebalanced all energy gain across the board.",
